# 👋 Hi, I’m Aryaan Hashim

### 🚀 Cloud and AI Automation Engineer  
### 🎓 Software Engineering Graduate – Monash University  
### 📍 Based in Melbourne, Australia  

I like taking messy real world problems and turning them into working cloud and AI systems.  
While studying full time I built production style projects that combine **data**, **ML**, **AI agents**, **APIs**, and **Azure cloud**.

I am early in my career but I already ship things people can use.

## ⚡ What I Do

### Cloud Engineering
- Azure identity, networking, storage, compute and security basics  
- Deploying containerised apps with Docker and Azure services  
- CI and CD with GitHub Actions and practical scripting

### AI and Automation
- Azure AI Foundry agents and tools  
- Retrieval augmented generation workflows  
- Backend APIs with FastAPI that talk to AI models and external systems  

### Data and Machine Learning
- Data cleaning, feature engineering and EDA in Python  
- Supervised ML for classification and regression  
- Model evaluation, metrics and experiment tracking  
- Serving models behind APIs for real use cases  

### Power Platform
- Power Automate flows that remove manual work  
- Dataverse and custom connectors  
- Combining cloud backends with low code frontends

## 🚀 Flagship Project 1 – AURA: AI Real Estate Copilot

**AURA** is a cloud deployed AI copilot that helps people understand Australian property and rent versus buy decisions.

**What it does**
- Analyses suburbs, affordability and long term trends  
- Breaks down rent, mortgage, deposits and cash flow  
- Answers questions through a conversational AI interface  

**What I built**
- Azure AI Agent with tools and memory  
- FastAPI backend talking to the agent and data sources  
- Docker based deployment to Azure  
- Retrieval layer for structured housing and suburb data  

AURA shows how I think about end to end AI products, not just isolated scripts.

## 📊 Flagship Project 2 – Customer Risk AI (Data and ML Project)

**Customer Risk AI** is my data heavy project that focuses on building and serving a machine learning model for risk scoring.

**Problem it solves**
A business wants to understand which customers are likely to be risky so it can make better decisions on approvals and limits.

**What I built**
- Full data pipeline: loading raw CSV data, cleaning, handling missing values and encoding categorical features  
- Exploratory data analysis to understand distributions, correlations and leakage  
- Binary classification model for customer risk using models like Logistic Regression and Tree based methods  
- Training and evaluation with metrics such as ROC AUC, precision, recall and confusion matrix  
- Clear separation of:
  - `data` – ingestion and preprocessing  
  - `model` – training and evaluation  
  - `api` – FastAPI service that exposes a `/predict` endpoint  
- Dockerised app running with Uvicorn so the model can be queried like a real service  

This project proves I can go from **raw dataset → ML model → production style API** on my own.

### 🔥 Why I Am Different

I am already building **cloud ready**, **data driven**, **AI powered** systems by myself.

If you want someone who can learn fast, own problems and ship real solutions from day one, I would love to talk.
